## Count of elements in an array in sorted order.

Write a logic to the function to count the occurrences of each element in an array and print the output in a sorted order. 

For example, if {14, 10, 14, 9, 11, 9, 11, 14} is the input array, then the count of occurrences of each element in sorted order is {9:2, 10:1, 11:2, 14:3}.
